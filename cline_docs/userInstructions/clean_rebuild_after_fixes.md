# Instructions: Clean and Rebuild Solution

Please perform a clean and rebuild of the `ScriptSchedulerApp` solution in Visual Studio or using the command line to ensure all previous build artifacts are removed and the code is recompiled with the recent fixes.

**Using Visual Studio:**

1.  Open the `ScriptSchedulerApp.sln` solution in Visual Studio.
2.  Go to the **Build** menu.
3.  Select **Clean Solution**.
4.  Wait for the clean process to complete (check the Output window).
5.  Go to the **Build** menu again.
6.  Select **Rebuild Solution**.
7.  Check the **Error List** window to see if the compilation errors we addressed are gone.

**Using Command Line (Developer Command Prompt):**

1.  Open the Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio.
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```cmd
    cd "c:\ClaudeAI_Projects\Visual Basic Script Wrapper for Scheduled Scripts NetWorkShare"
    ```
3.  Clean the solution:
    ```cmd
    msbuild ScriptSchedulerApp.sln /t:Clean
    ```
4.  Rebuild the solution:
    ```cmd
    msbuild ScriptSchedulerApp.sln /t:Rebuild /p:Configuration=Debug /p:Platform="Any CPU"
    ```
    (Adjust Configuration/Platform if needed, e.g., use `Release` if that's your target).
5.  Observe the output for any compilation errors.

Let me know the results of the rebuild. If there are still errors, please provide the updated error list.
