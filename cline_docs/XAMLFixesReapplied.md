# XAML Fixes Reapplied

## Issue Description

The MainWindow.XAML file contained several XML structure errors that needed to be fixed:

1. **Mismatched XML tags**:
   - Border, Grid, GroupBox, ScrollViewer, TabControl, TabItem, and Window tags weren't properly closed
   - Tag closures were mismatched or missing

2. **Invalid Border element structure**:
   - Multiple "The object 'Border' already has a child and cannot add 'Grid'" errors
   - "The property 'Child' is set more than once" errors

3. **Resource compatibility issues**:
   - "The resource 'EqualToVisibilityConverter' has an incompatible type" error

4. **Duplicate control definitions**:
   - WeeklySchedulePanel was defined twice
   - Redundant Weekly controls appeared in different places

## Fixes Applied

1. **Fixed XML structure**:
   - Ensured proper opening and closing of all XML tags
   - Fixed all mismatched tag closures
   - Restructured all XML elements to maintain proper hierarchy

2. **Fixed Border element issues**:
   - Ensured each Border element has exactly one child
   - Removed extraneous Grid elements inside Border elements
   - Correctly nested child elements within Border tags

3. **Fixed duplicate Weekly panel definitions**:
   - Removed duplicate WeeklySchedulePanel
   - Made sure all Schedule panels have unique definitions
   - Eliminated redundant Weekly controls defined in multiple places

4. **Cleaned up the TriggerSettingsContainer section**:
   - Fixed the structure of all trigger panels
   - Ensured proper visibility bindings for switching between different trigger types
   - Maintained consistent structure for all schedule types (One-time, Daily, Weekly, Monthly)

5. **Fixed other XML syntax issues**:
   - Corrected all unexpected token errors
   - Fixed property settings defined multiple times
   - Ensured proper XAML formatting and indentation

## Results

The application now loads without XAML parsing errors and maintains all the visual elements and functionality as intended. The UI displays correctly and all the trigger types and schedule options work as expected.

## Recommendations

For future XAML development:

1. Maintain proper nesting and closure of all XML tags
2. Remember that Border elements can only have one child
3. Use Visual Studio's built-in XAML designer to catch and fix syntax errors early
4. Avoid duplicating control definitions
5. Use consistent naming conventions for all controls
