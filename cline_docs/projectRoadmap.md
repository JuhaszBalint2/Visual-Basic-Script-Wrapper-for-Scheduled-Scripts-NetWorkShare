# Project Roadmap: Script Wrapper and Scheduler for Network Shares

## Project Goals
- [x] Create script wrapper generator for network scripts
- [x] Develop a scheduled task creation utility
- [x] Fix task creation issues with spaces in paths
- [x] Implement proper error handling and logging
- [x] Create a robust solution for network path access in scheduled tasks
- [x] Replace VBS wrappers with C# executable wrappers
- [x] Remove PowerShell dependencies and create pure C# implementation
- [x] Fix wrapper compilation issues

## Key Features
- [x] Script wrapper generation for different script types (PowerShell, Python, Batch)
- [x] UTF-8 encoding support for proper character handling
- [x] Network path handling 
- [x] Proper quoting and escaping for paths with spaces
- [x] Detailed logging for troubleshooting
