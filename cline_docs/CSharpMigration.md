# Migration to Pure C# Implementation

## Overview

This document details the architectural changes made to transition the Script Scheduler application from a hybrid PowerShell/VBS/C# solution to a pure C# implementation. This change addresses the "Failed to compile wrapper" error by removing all dependencies on VBS and PowerShell scripts.

## Key Changes

### 1. Replaced VBS Wrappers with C# Executables

- Created a `TaskWrapper` class that generates and compiles C# executable wrappers
- The new wrappers provide the same functionality as the VBS wrappers but with better error handling and logging
- Compilation happens at runtime using the C# compiler (csc.exe)

### 2. Command-Line Interface

- Added a `Program.cs` entry point with command-line parsing capabilities
- Provides direct command-line access to wrapper creation and task scheduling
- Maintains backward compatibility with previous script usage patterns

### 3. Native Task Scheduler Integration

- Enhanced the existing Task Scheduler integration to eliminate PowerShell script dependencies
- Created a `TaskCreator` class to handle all task creation operations directly in C#
- Improved error handling with more detailed messages

### 4. Project Structure Improvements

- Removed all PowerShell scripts from the build process
- Updated project file to exclude PS1 and VBS files
- Set proper entry point to Program.cs

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Deployment**: No more dependencies on external scripts
2. **Improved Performance**: Direct C# implementation is faster than PowerShell scripting
3. **Better Error Handling**: More detailed error messages and logging
4. **Enhanced Security**: No script execution needed, reducing security risks
5. **Reduced Complexity**: Single technology stack
6. **Better Debugging**: Integrated debugging experience in Visual Studio

## Implementation Details

### C# Wrapper Generation

The `TaskWrapper` class generates a C# source file that:

1. Takes the original script path, arguments, and working directory
2. Sets up a structured logging system
3. Creates an appropriate process to execute the script with the correct parameters
4. Captures standard output and standard error
5. Logs execution details and any errors
6. Returns the original script's exit code

The source code is then compiled to a standalone executable using the C# compiler (csc.exe).

### Task Scheduler Integration

The `TaskCreator` class uses the Task Scheduler library to:

1. Create properly configured task definitions
2. Set up triggers based on user specifications (one-time, daily, weekly, etc.)
3. Configure principals with the correct privileges
4. Set actions to execute either the original script or the C# wrapper
5. Register the task with Windows Task Scheduler

### Command-Line Interface

The command-line interface provides:

- Help system with detailed option descriptions
- Support for both long and short option formats
- Validation of required parameters
- Sensible defaults for optional parameters
- Error handling with informative messages

## Usage Examples

### Creating a C# Wrapper for a PowerShell Script

```
ScriptSchedulerApp.exe create-wrapper --script="\\server\share\scripts\Report.ps1" --output="C:\Wrappers\Report.exe"
```

### Creating a Daily Scheduled Task

```
ScriptSchedulerApp.exe create-task --name="Daily Backup" --script="C:\Scripts\Backup.ps1" --trigger=DAILY --interval=1 --wrapper=true
```

## Conclusion

This migration to a pure C# implementation addresses the "Failed to compile wrapper" error by eliminating the dependency on VBS scripts and PowerShell. The new architecture is more robust, easier to maintain, and provides a better user experience while maintaining all the functionality of the original solution.
