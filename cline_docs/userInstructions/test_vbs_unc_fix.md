Please follow these steps to test the fix for the VBScript UNC path error:

1.  **Clean and Rebuild the Solution:**
    *   In Visual Studio, go to the `Build` menu.
    *   Select `Clean Solution`.
    *   Once cleaning is complete, go to the `Build` menu again.
    *   Select `Rebuild Solution`.
    *   Ensure the rebuild completes without errors.

2.  **Test VBS Wrapper Generation and Execution:**
    *   Run the `ScriptSchedulerApp.exe` application (likely located in `ScriptSchedulerApp/bin/Debug/net6.0-windows/` or similar).
    *   Use the application to create a new scheduled task with the *exact same settings* as the "test3" task that caused the original error:
        *   Script: `\\192.168.1.238\System Administration Folder\Scheduled Scripts\test3.ps1`
        *   Working Directory: `\\192.168.1.238\System Administration Folder\Scheduled Scripts`
        *   Ensure "Create VBS Wrapper" is checked.
        *   VBS Wrapper Location: `\\192.168.1.238\System Administration Folder\Scheduled Scripts\VBS Wrapper Scripts` (or wherever you want the new wrapper generated).
    *   Verify that a new `.vbs` file (e.g., `test3.vbs` or similar, depending on the task name you used) is created in the specified VBS Wrapper Location without any errors reported by the application.
    *   **Manually inspect the generated `.vbs` file:** Open it with a text editor and confirm that the line `WshShell.CurrentDirectory = ...` is now commented out (starts with a single quote `'`).
    *   **Attempt to run the generated `.vbs` file directly:** Double-click the `.vbs` file in Windows Explorer.
    *   Verify that the script runs *without* the "A megadott elérési út érvénytelen" (Invalid path specified) error.
    *   Check the log file created by the VBS wrapper (it should be in `C:\Temp\` based on the VBS code) to confirm the target PowerShell script (`test3.ps1`) executed successfully and logged its completion with an exit code.

Please report back the results of these steps, specifically:
*   Did the solution rebuild successfully?
*   Was the VBS wrapper generated?
*   Was the `CurrentDirectory` line commented out in the generated VBS file?
*   Did the VBS file run without the "Invalid path" error when double-clicked?
*   Did the log file indicate successful execution of the target script?
