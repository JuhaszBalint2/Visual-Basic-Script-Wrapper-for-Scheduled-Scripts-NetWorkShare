# XAML Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

The following XAML and code-related issues have been resolved:

1. **Duplicate Control Definitions**
   - Fixed duplicate WeeklySchedulePanel definition
   - Removed duplicate Weekly control elements (checkboxes, comboboxes, etc.)
   - Restructured the Schedule panels to eliminate duplication

2. **Border with Multiple Children Error**
   - Fixed the structure of the Border elements
   - Ensured each Border has exactly one child element

3. **EqualityToVisibilityConverter Issues**
   - Created a new `ValueEqualsParameterConverter` class to replace `EqualityToVisibilityConverter`
   - The converter serves the same function but with a more descriptive name
   - Properly implemented in the XAML resources section

## Implementation Details

### 1. Schedule Panels Structure
The XAML structure for the schedule panels now follows a cleaner hierarchy:
- TriggerSettingsContainer (Grid)
  - OneTimeSchedulePanel (StackPanel)
  - DailySchedulePanel (StackPanel)
  - WeeklySchedulePanel (StackPanel)
  - MonthlySchedulePanel (StackPanel)
  - StartupTriggerPanel (StackPanel)
  - LogonTriggerPanel (StackPanel)

Each panel is properly layered with no duplications.

### 2. Monthly Trigger Panel
The Monthly panel includes two options:
- Day of month (e.g., "On day 15 of every month")
- Day of week in month (e.g., "On the first Monday of every month")

Both options are implemented with proper radio button selection.

### 3. Email Action Support
Added support for email notifications through:
- EmailActionSupport.cs - Provides extension methods for email actions
- TaskSchedulerActions.cs - Manages multiple actions in a task

### 4. Value Converter
Replaced the problematic `EqualityToVisibilityConverter` with `ValueEqualsParameterConverter` that:
- Converts a value to Visibility.Visible if it equals the parameter
- Otherwise returns Visibility.Collapsed
- Supports both integer and string comparisons

## Testing Notes

The fixed XAML should now compile without:
- "The name X is already defined in this scope" errors
- "The object 'Border' already has a child" errors
- "The property 'Child' is set more than once" errors
- "The resource has an incompatible type" errors

The Monthly schedule trigger type has been fully implemented and should work correctly with the Windows Task Scheduler.
