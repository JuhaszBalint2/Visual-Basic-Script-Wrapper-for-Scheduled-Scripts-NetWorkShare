# Task Scheduler Features Implementation Plan

## Missing Features Analysis

After reviewing the Windows Task Scheduler native capabilities and comparing them with our current implementation, I've identified several key features that are missing from our application:

### Missing Trigger Types
1. Monthly triggers
2. On idle trigger
3. On event trigger
4. User session related triggers (connection, disconnection, lock, unlock)
5. At task creation/modification trigger

### Missing Actions
1. Send email action
2. Display message action
3. Multiple actions support

### Missing Settings
1. Run whether user is logged on or not (specific logon options)
2. Do not store password option
3. Configure for specific OS version
4. Advanced trigger settings (repetition, duration)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: High-Priority Features
1. **Monthly Trigger Support**
   - Add MonthlyTrigger implementation
   - Create UI for monthly schedule configuration
   - Support both day-of-month and day-of-week options

2. **On Idle Trigger**
   - Add dedicated trigger type for idle conditions
   - Simplify existing idle settings

3. **Multiple Actions Support**
   - Modify UI to allow adding multiple program actions
   - Implement action list management (add, edit, remove)

4. **Email Notification Action**
   - Add SendEmailAction implementation
   - Create UI for configuring email parameters

### Phase 2: Additional Features
1. **Event Trigger Support**
   - Add EventTrigger implementation
   - Create UI for selecting event sources and IDs

2. **User Session Triggers**
   - Add SessionStateChangeTrigger for logon/logoff events
   - Add UI for specifying user session states

3. **Additional Settings**
   - Configure for specific OS version
   - Enhanced password management options

## Implementation Approach

### UI Changes
- Add new trigger types to the TriggerTypeComboBox
- Create necessary panels for configuring new trigger types
- Add tabs or sections for configuring multiple actions
- Enhance settings UI to include all Task Scheduler options

### Backend Changes
- Extend TaskSchedulerExtensions.cs to support all trigger types
- Add specific configuration methods for each trigger type
- Implement all action types
- Add complete handling of all Task Scheduler settings

### Testing Strategy
- Test each trigger type individually
- Verify combinations of triggers, actions and settings
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing tasks
