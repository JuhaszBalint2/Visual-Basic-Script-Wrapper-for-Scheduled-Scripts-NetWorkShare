# Project Roadmap: Script Wrapper and Scheduler for Network Shares

## Project Goals
- [x] Create script wrapper generator for network scripts
- [x] Develop a scheduled task creation utility
- [x] Fix task creation issues with spaces in paths
- [x] Implement proper error handling and logging
- [x] Create a robust solution for network path access in scheduled tasks
- [x] Replace VBS wrappers with C# executable wrappers
- [x] Remove PowerShell dependencies and create pure C# implementation
- [x] Fix wrapper compilation issues
- [x] Add full Windows Task Scheduler feature parity

## Key Features
- [x] Script wrapper generation for different script types (PowerShell, Python, Batch)
- [x] UTF-8 encoding support for proper character handling
- [x] Network path handling 
- [x] Proper quoting and escaping for paths with spaces
- [x] Detailed logging for troubleshooting
- [x] User-friendly error messages
- [x] Windows Credential Manager integration
- [x] Reliable C# wrapper compilation
- [x] Command-line interface for automation
- [x] Windows 10/11 compatibility with required admin privileges
