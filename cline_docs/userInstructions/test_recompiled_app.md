# Instructions for Testing the Recompiled ScriptSchedulerApp

Please follow these steps to test if the recent fix for handling paths with spaces in scheduled task creation was successful:

1.  **Navigate to the Build Output Directory:**
    Open File Explorer and go to the following directory:
    `c:\ClaudeAI_Projects\Visual Basic Script Wrapper for Scheduled Scripts NetWorkShare\ScriptSchedulerApp\bin\Release\net6.0-windows\`

2.  **Run the Application:**
    Double-click the `ScriptSchedulerApp.exe` file to launch the application.

3.  **Recreate the Failing Task:**
    *   In the application, select the script that was previously failing due to the space in its path: `\\192.168.1.238\System Administration Folder\Scheduled Scripts\test3.ps1`.
    *   Configure the task exactly as you did before when it failed. Use the details from your initial message:
        *   Task Name: `test3`
        *   Description: (Leave blank or add one)
        *   Arguments: (Leave blank or add if needed)
        *   Working Directory: `\\192.168.1.238\System Administration Folder\Scheduled Scripts`
        *   Run As: `JUHASZ-I25KK4DI\Juhász Bálint József` (or the appropriate user)
        *   Highest Privileges: `True`
        *   Create VBS Wrapper: `True`
        *   VBS Location: `\\192.168.1.238\System Administration Folder\Scheduled Scripts\VBS Wrapper Scripts`
        *   Trigger: On a schedule, Start Date: `2025-04-23` (or today), Start Time: `21:52` (or a near future time)
        *   Settings: Match the settings from your initial example (Allow demand run, Run if missed, Restart settings, Stop if longer than 3 hours, Do not start new instance).
    *   Click through the "Next" buttons until you reach the final tab, then click "Create Task".

4.  **Verify Task Creation:**
    *   Open the Windows Task Scheduler (you can search for "Task Scheduler" in the Start menu).
    *   In the Task Scheduler Library, look for the task named "test3".
    *   Check if the task was created successfully. You can also look at the "Last Run Result" column after the scheduled time passes, although just confirming its creation is the main goal now.

5.  **Report the Outcome:**
    Let me know whether the task was created successfully or if you encountered any errors during the process.
