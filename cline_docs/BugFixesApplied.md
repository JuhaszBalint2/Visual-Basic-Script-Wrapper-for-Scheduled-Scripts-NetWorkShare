# Bug Fixes Applied

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Converter Issues
- Fixed "The resource 'EqualToVisibilityConverter' has an incompatible type" error
- Created an `EqualityToVisibilityConverter` class in the ScriptSchedulerApp namespace
- Implemented proper IValueConverter interface methods for visibility conversion

### 2. Missing Controls in MainWindow.xaml
- Added missing Email-related controls:
  - EmailActionPanel (Grid container)
  - EmailFromTextBox
  - EmailToTextBox
  - EmailSubjectTextBox
  - EmailMessageTextBox
  - SmtpServerTextBox
  - SmtpPortTextBox
  - SmtpSecureCheckBox
- Fixed layout and styling to match the application's design

### 3. TaskSchedulerExtensions Method Ambiguity
- Renamed `AddEmailAction` method to `CreateEmailAction` to resolve ambiguity
- Preserved all original functionality and parameters
- Fixed "The call is ambiguous between the following methods" error

### 4. MonthlyTrigger Property Issues
- Fixed "MonthlyTrigger does not contain a definition for MonthInterval" error
- Updated code to use `MonthsOfYear` property instead of the nonexistent `MonthInterval`
- Implemented logic to translate interval values (1, 2, 3, 6, 12) to appropriate month patterns:
  - 1: All months
  - 2: Alternating months (Jan, Mar, May, Jul, Sep, Nov)
  - 3: Quarterly (Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct)
  - 6: Semi-annually (Jan, Jul)
  - 12: Once a year (Jan)
- Applied similar fix to `MonthlyDOWTrigger` to use the correct property

## Implementation Details

1. **EqualityToVisibilityConverter**:
   - Created in Converters folder
   - Implemented IValueConverter interface with proper Convert and ConvertBack methods
   - Used for visibility binding in the XAML UI

2. **Email UI Controls**:
   - Added complete email form with all necessary fields
   - Placed within the existing action control structure
   - Set initial visibility to collapsed (hidden by default)
   - Maintained consistent styling with the application's design language

3. **TaskSchedulerExtensions**:
   - Renamed method to avoid ambiguity while preserving functionality
   - Ensures no conflicts with the library's own methods

4. **Monthly Trigger Scheduling**:
   - Replaced invalid `MonthsInterval` property with correct `MonthsOfYear` enum property
   - Implemented a mapping system to convert numeric intervals to appropriate month combinations
   - Applied consistent approach for both MonthlyTrigger and MonthlyDOWTrigger

## Testing Needs

The application should now compile without errors and allow:
1. Proper display of schedule types based on user selection (via the converter)
2. Email task creation functionality
3. Monthly scheduling with proper interval settings

## Additional Notes
- All fixes maintain the original intended functionality
- No new features were added, only corrected implementation of existing features
- Code structure and organization follows the application's established patterns
