## Current Task: Update App Manifest for Windows 10/11 Compatibility and Admin Privileges

**Objective:** Configure the application to only run on Windows 10 and Windows 11, and always run with administrator privileges.

**Context:** The application needs to ensure it has the required privileges to create scheduled tasks and access network shares. It also needs to be compatible with only modern Windows versions (10 and 11).

**Steps Completed:**

1. **Updated app.manifest File:**
   * Modified the existing app.manifest file to explicitly support only Windows 10 and Windows 11
   * Ensured requestedExecutionLevel is set to "requireAdministrator" for mandatory admin privileges
   * Added proper XML comments for better maintainability
   * Added dependency on Microsoft.Windows.Common-Controls for better theme integration
   * Verified ApplicationManifest property in ScriptSchedulerApp.csproj is correctly set

**Result:** The application is now configured to:
   * Only run on Windows 10 and Windows 11 systems
   * Always request administrator privileges when launched
   * Properly apply Windows theming to common controls and dialogs

**Status:** Complete

## Previous Task: Fix Compiler Errors and UI Control Issues

**Objective:** Resolve multiple compiler errors and missing UI controls in the Script Scheduler application.

**Context:** The application showed 17 different errors related to missing controls, incompatible types, ambiguous method calls, and non-existent properties.

**Steps Completed:**

1. **Fixed Converter Issues:**
   * Created missing `EqualityToVisibilityConverter` class in the Converters folder
   * Implemented IValueConverter interface with proper Convert and ConvertBack methods
   * Resolved "incompatible type" XAML errors

2. **Added Missing Email UI Controls:**
   * Added EmailActionPanel with all related controls:
     * EmailFromTextBox, EmailToTextBox, EmailSubjectTextBox
     * EmailMessageTextBox, SmtpServerTextBox, SmtpPortTextBox
     * SmtpSecureCheckBox
   * Maintained consistent styling with application design
   * Fixed all related "does not exist in the current context" errors

3. **Resolved Method Ambiguity in TaskSchedulerExtensions:**
   * Renamed `AddEmailAction` method to `CreateEmailAction`
   * Preserved all parameters and functionality
   * Fixed ambiguous method call error

4. **Fixed Monthly Trigger Property Issues:**
   * Updated code to use `MonthsOfYear` property instead of non-existent `MonthInterval`
   * Implemented mapping logic to convert interval values (1, 2, 3, 6, 12) to appropriate month patterns
   * Applied similar fixes to MonthlyDOWTrigger
   * Fixed "does not contain a definition for MonthInterval" errors

5. **Updated Documentation:**
   * Created BugFixesApplied.md with detailed explanations of all changes
   * Updated currentTask.md to reflect completed work

**Result:** All 17 compiler errors have been resolved. The application should now compile and run with full functionality for all UI elements and task scheduling features.

**Status:** Complete
